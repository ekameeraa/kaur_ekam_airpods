## History

1. To start with this project, I initially built a 3D model in Cinema 4D and integrated it into an AR model viewer to showcase its features in my previous coding.
2. Additionally, I created a promotional video by incorporating my AirPods into After Effects.
3. Now, I am moving forward to showcase these elements through coding, demonstrating how to promote these objects effectively for users.
